      "Okay, let's see. The user wants to improve their current prompt for a zero-shot instruction task. The existing prompt is: \"Let's brainstorm potential strategies and evaluate them sequentially to determine the most effective path forward.\" They provided a correct example where the model successfully proved that sqrt(2) is irrational using a step-by-step contradiction approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to analyze why the current prompt worked for that example. The example involved a structured proof with clear steps leading to a contradiction. The current prompt encourages brainstorming strategies and evaluating them step by step, which probably led the model to break down the problem into those steps. But maybe the prompt can be refined to better guide the model in similar tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the correct answer, the key elements are: assumption, logical steps, identification of contradiction, and conclusion. The current prompt mentions strategies and evaluation, but perhaps it's too vague. The model might benefit from more explicit instructions on structuring the answer, especially for mathematical proofs or logical reasoning tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants the prompt to be effective for zero-shot tasks, so it needs to be general enough but still guide the model to produce structured, logical answers. The example shows that the model needs to not only generate steps but also validate each step and ensure they lead to the conclusion. Maybe the prompt should emphasize breaking down the problem, checking each step for validity, and explicitly stating contradictions or conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the original answer starts with a proof by contradiction. The prompt might need to encourage considering different methods (like contradiction, induction, etc.) but then systematically evaluating which one applies. However, since the example used contradiction, maybe the prompt should push the model to identify the appropriate method first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is the conclusion. The current answer ends with a clear statement of the result. The prompt should ensure that the model doesn't just list steps but also synthesizes the conclusion from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possible improvements could include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Explicitly instructing to start by selecting an appropriate method (e.g., proof by contradiction).\n",
      "2. Breaking down the problem into sequential steps with justifications.\n",
      "3. Checking each step for logical consistency.\n",
      "4. Concluding with a synthesis of the findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, using verbs like \"identify the optimal method,\" \"validate each step,\" and \"clearly state the conclusion\" might help structure the response better. The original prompt uses \"brainstorm\" and \"evaluate,\" which are good, but adding more structure could enhance performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing this with the example: If the prompt tells the model to choose a method, break into steps, validate each, and conclude, then the model is more likely to produce the structured proof seen in the correct example. The improved prompt should encapsulate these elements without being overly specific to one type of problem, maintaining zero-shot capability.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, combining these thoughts, the revised prompt might look something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"First, identify the optimal problem-solving method for the task. Then, decompose the problem into sequential logical steps, rigorously validating each step's validity. Finally, synthesize the validated steps into a coherent conclusion, explicitly highlighting any contradictions or critical insights that confirm the solution.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "</think>\n",

      "Okay, let's see. The user wants to improve their current prompt for a zero-shot instruction task in mathematics. The existing prompt is: \"You are a mathematics expert. You will be given a mathematics problem which you need to solve. Identify the core assumptions influencing the problem, use them to formulate potential strategies, and analyze each approach sequentially to refine the solution.\"\n",

      "They provided a correct example where the question was solving the inequality 3x - 7 > 5, and the answer was x > 4. The answer shows the steps: adding 7 to both sides and then dividing by 3. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to analyze why this example was solved correctly. The problem is a linear inequality, which is straightforward. The steps taken are standard for solving such inequalities. The core assumptions here might be understanding that inequalities are solved similarly to equations, but with attention to direction changes (though in this case, dividing by a positive 3 doesn't change the direction). The strategy was to isolate x by inverse operations. The reasoning chain is short: two steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants to improve the prompt so that it's effective for zero-shot tasks, meaning the model hasn't seen examples but needs to generalize. The current prompt tells the model to identify core assumptions, formulate strategies, analyze approaches. But maybe the example's success is due to the model implicitly knowing standard procedures for linear inequalities. However, for more complex problems, the model might need more explicit guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the current prompt, it's a bit vague. \"Core assumptions\" might not be specific enough. The example didn't require multiple strategies, just a straightforward method. So perhaps the prompt needs to be more structured, guiding the model through a specific problem-solving process. Also, the answer format in the example is concise, showing the steps and the final answer. The prompt might benefit from specifying the output format.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possible improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Explicit Step-by-Step Instruction**: The example shows step-by-step reasoning. The prompt could ask the model to break down the solution into clear, sequential steps, explaining each one. This would help in more complex problems where multiple steps are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarify Core Assumptions**: Instead of just \"identify core assumptions,\" specify that the model should state any mathematical principles or rules applied (like properties of inequalities, order of operations, etc.). This makes the reasoning more explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 **Output Format Specification**: The example uses <ANS_START> and <ANS_END> tags. The prompt should instruct the model to present the final answer within these tags, possibly after showing the steps. This ensures consistency in output, which is crucial for automated grading or parsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Encourage Verification**: Adding a step to check the solution could help catch errors. For example, substituting the answer back into the original inequality to verify.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Handling Different Problem Types**: The example is an inequality. The prompt should be general enough to handle various math problems (algebra, calculus, etc.), so the instructions need to be adaptable. Mentioning different problem types might help the model apply the right strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Explicit Mention of Mathematical Domains**: Since the example is algebra, but the prompt is for math in general, specifying areas like algebra, calculus, geometry could guide the model to use appropriate methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Encourage Explanation of Why a Strategy is Chosen**: The current prompt says \"formulate potential strategies,\" but the example uses a straightforward method. For more complex problems, explaining why a particular strategy is selected over others could improve the solution's robustness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting this together, the revised prompt should guide the model through a structured process: problem understanding, applying relevant principles, step-by-step solving, verification, and clear answer formatting. This structure would help in zero-shot scenarios by making the model's approach systematic, reducing the chance of missing steps or making implicit assumptions that aren't valid.\n",

      "[Question] A triangle has sides 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm. Calculate its area.\n",
      "[Answer] <think>\n",
      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the area of a triangle with sides 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm. Hmm, first, I need to recall the different methods to calculate the area of a triangle. The most common ones are using the base and height (Area = ½ * base * height) or Heron's formula, which requires knowing all three sides. Since all three sides are given here, Heron's formula might be the way to go. But wait, maybe there's a shortcut if the triangle is a right-angled triangle. Let me check if these sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me verify if 7² + 24² equals 25². Calculating 7 squared is 49, 24 squared is 576, so adding those gives 49 + 576 = 625. Now, 25 squared is 625. Oh, that's a match! So this is a right-angled triangle with legs 7 cm and 24 cm, and hypotenuse 25 cm. That simplifies things because the area of a right-angled triangle is just half the product of the two legs. So instead of using Heron's formula, which would involve more calculations, I can just take ½ * 7 * 24. Let me compute that: 7 times 24 is 168, half of that is 84. So the area should be 84 cm². \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check using Heron's formula to ensure consistency. Heron's formula states that the area is the square root of [s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter. The semi-perimeter s would be (7 + 24 + 25)/2 = 56/2 = 28 cm. Then the area is sqrt(28*(28-7)*(28-24)*(28-25)) = sqrt(28*21*4*3). Calculating inside the square root: 28*21 is 588, 4*3 is 12, so 588*12 = 7056. The square root of 7056 is 84. Yep, that matches the earlier result. So both methods confirm the area is 84 cm². \n",

      "I should also make sure that the triangle is indeed right-angled by confirming the Pythagorean theorem again. 7² + 24² = 25², which we already checked. All steps seem correct, and both methods lead to the same answer. No negative values or inconsistencies here. The answer must be 84 cm².\n",

      "[Question] Find the dimensions of a rectangular box with volume 1000 cm³ that minimizes the surface area.\n",
      "[Answer] <think>\n",
      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the dimensions of a rectangular box with a volume of 1000 cm³ that minimizes the surface area. Hmm, I remember from calculus that optimization problems often involve taking derivatives to find minima or maxima. Since we're dealing with a box, it's a three-dimensional shape, so we'll need to consider length, width, and height.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to define the variables. The problem mentions a rectangular box, but it doesn't specify whether it's a square-based box or not. Wait, in the example provided earlier, they assumed a square base for symmetry. Maybe that's a hint here. If we assume the base is square, that simplifies things because the length and width would be equal. Let me confirm that assumption. If the base is square, then length = width = x, and the height can be h. That reduces the number of variables, making the problem easier to handle with calculus.\n",

      "So, let's set the variables:\n",

      "- Let h be the height of the box (in cm).\n",

      "x²h = 1000\n",
      "From this equation, we can express h in terms of x:\n",
      "h = 1000 / x²\n",

      "Next, we need to find the surface area of the box. The surface area (S) of a rectangular box is calculated as:\n",
      "S = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n",

      "[Question] If you roll two dice, what’s the probability the sum is 7?\n",
      "[Answer] <think>\n",
      "Okay, let's tackle this probability problem. The question is asking for the probability that the sum of two dice rolls is 7. Alright, first, I need to remember how probability works for dice. Each die has 6 faces, so when rolling two dice, the total number of possible outcomes should be 6 multiplied by 6, which is 36. That makes sense because each die is independent, so each outcome on the first die can pair with any outcome on the second die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the next step is to figure out how many of those outcomes result in a sum of 7. Let me list them out. Starting with the first die showing 1, the second die needs to be 6 to make 7. Then if the first die is 2, the second should be 5. Continuing this pattern: (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1). That gives me six different pairs. Let me count them again to be sure: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). Yep, that's six combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should check if there are any other combinations I might have missed. For example, does (0,7) count? No, because dice only go up to 6. So those six are all the possible pairs that add up to 7. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the number of favorable outcomes is 6, and the total outcomes are 36. Therefore, the probability is 6 divided by 36, which simplifies to 1/6. Let me verify that. 6 divided by 36 is indeed 1/6. Also, making sure that all pairs are distinct and none are repeated. Since each die is distinguishable, (1,6) and (6,1) are different outcomes, but both sum to 7. So all six are valid and accounted for. \n",

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to prove that √2 is irrational using proof by contradiction. I remember that irrational numbers can't be expressed as a fraction of two integers. So, the strategy here is to assume the opposite and then find a contradiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll start by assuming that √2 is rational. That means it can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors (since the fraction is in lowest terms). So, √2 = a/b. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I'll square both sides to eliminate the square root. That gives 2 = a²/b². Multiplying both sides by b², we get 2b² = a². This implies that a² is even because it's equal to 2 times some integer (b²). If a² is even, then a must also be even. Because the square of an odd number is odd, so if a were odd, a² would be odd, which contradicts a² being even. Therefore, a is even, which means a can be written as 2k for some integer k.\n",
      "\n",
      "Substituting a = 2k back into the equation 2b² = a² gives 2b² = (2k)² = 4k². Dividing both sides by 2, we get b² = 2k². Now, this equation tells us that b² is also even, which means b must be even as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the problem: if both a and b are even, they share a common factor of 2. This contradicts our initial assumption that a and b are coprime (have no common factors other than 1). Since we arrived at a contradiction, our original assumption that √2 is rational must be false. Therefore, √2 is irrational.\n",

Hmm, first, I need to recall the different methods to calculate the area of a triangle. The most common ones are using the base and height (Area = ½ * base * height) or Heron's formula, which requires knowing all three sides. Since all three sides are given here, Heron's formula might be the way to go. But wait, maybe there's a shortcut if the triangle is a right-angled triangle. Let me check if these sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me verify if 7² + 24² equals 25². Calculating 7 squared is 49, 24 squared is 576, so adding those gives 49 + 576 = 625. Now, 25 squared is 625. Oh, that's a match! So this is a right-angled triangle with legs 7 cm and 24 cm, and hypotenuse 25 cm. That simplifies things because the area of a right-angled triangle is just half the product of the two legs. So instead of using Heron's formula, which would involve more calculations, I can just take ½ * 7 * 24. Let me compute that: 7 times 24 is 168, half of that is 84. So the area should be 84 cm². \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check using Heron's formula to ensure consistency. Heron's formula states that the area is the square root of [s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter. The semi-perimeter s would be (7 + 24 + 25)/2 = 56/2 = 28 cm. Then the area is sqrt(28*(28-7)*(28-24)*(28-25)) = sqrt(28*21*4*3). Calculating inside the square root: 28*21 is 588, 4*3 is 12, so 588*12 = 7056. The square root of 7056 is 84. Yep, that matches the earlier result. So both methods confirm the area is 84 cm². \n",

      "[Question] Find the dimensions of a rectangular box with volume 1000 cm³ that minimizes the surface area.\n",
      "[Answer] <think>\n",
      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the dimensions of a rectangular box with a volume of 1000 cm³ that minimizes the surface area. Hmm, I remember from calculus that optimization problems often involve taking derivatives to find minima or maxima. Since we're dealing with a box, it's a three-dimensional shape, so we'll need to consider length, width, and height.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to define the variables. The problem mentions a rectangular box, but it doesn't specify whether it's a square-based box or not. Wait, in the example provided earlier, they assumed a square base for symmetry. Maybe that's a hint here. If we assume the base is square, that simplifies things because the length and width would be equal. Let me confirm that assumption. If the base is square, then length = width = x, and the height can be h. That reduces the number of variables, making the problem easier to handle with calculus.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's set the variables:\n",
      "- Let x be the length and width of the square base (in cm).\n",
      "- Let h be the height of the box (in cm).\n",

      "From this equation, we can express h in terms of x:\n",
      "h = 1000 / x²\n",

      "[Question] If you roll two dice, what’s the probability the sum is 7?\n",
      "[Answer] <think>\n",
      "Okay, let's tackle this probability problem. The question is asking for the probability that the sum of two dice rolls is 7. Alright, first, I need to remember how probability works for dice. Each die has 6 faces, so when rolling two dice, the total number of possible outcomes should be 6 multiplied by 6, which is 36. That makes sense because each die is independent, so each outcome on the first die can pair with any outcome on the second die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the next step is to figure out how many of those outcomes result in a sum of 7. Let me list them out. Starting with the first die showing 1, the second die needs to be 6 to make 7. Then if the first die is 2, the second should be 5. Continuing this pattern: (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1). That gives me six different pairs. Let me count them again to be sure: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). Yep, that's six combinations.\n",

      "So the number of favorable outcomes is 6, and the total outcomes are 36. Therefore, the probability is 6 divided by 36, which simplifies to 1/6.

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the area of a triangle with sides 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm. Hmm, first, I need to recall the different methods to calculate the area of a triangle. The most common ones are using the base and height (Area = ½ * base * height) or Heron's formula, which requires knowing all three sides. Since all three sides are given here, Heron's formula might be the way to go. But wait, maybe there's a shortcut if the triangle is a right-angled triangle. Let me check if these sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me verify if 7² + 24² equals 25². Calculating 7 squared is 49, 24 squared is 576, so adding those gives 49 + 576 = 625. Now, 25 squared is 625. Oh, that's a match! So this is a right-angled triangle with legs 7 cm and 24 cm, and hypotenuse 25 cm. That simplifies things because the area of a right-angled triangle is just half the product of the two legs. So instead of using Heron's formula, which would involve more calculations, I can just take ½ * 7 * 24. Let me compute that: 7 times 24 is 168, half of that is 84. So the area should be 84 cm². \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check using Heron's formula to ensure consistency. Heron's formula states that the area is the square root of [s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter. The semi-perimeter s would be (7 + 24 + 25)/2 = 56/2 = 28 cm. Then the area is sqrt(28*(28-7)*(28-24)*(28-25)) = sqrt(28*21*4*3). Calculating inside the square root: 28*21 is 588, 4*3 is 12, so 588*12 = 7056. The square root of 7056 is 84. Yep, that matches the earlier result. So both methods confirm the area is 84 cm². \n",

      "[Answer] <think>\n",
      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the dimensions of a rectangular box with a volume of 1000 cm³ that minimizes the surface area. Hmm, I remember from calculus that optimization problems often involve taking derivatives to find minima or maxima. Since we're dealing with a box, it's a three-dimensional shape, so we'll need to consider length, width, and height.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to define the variables. The problem mentions a rectangular box, but it doesn't specify whether it's a square-based box or not. Wait, in the example provided earlier, they assumed a square base for symmetry. Maybe that's a hint here. If we assume the base is square, that simplifies things because the length and width would be equal. Let me confirm that assumption. If the base is square, then length = width = x, and the height can be h. That reduces the number of variables, making the problem easier to handle with calculus.\n",

      "Okay, let's tackle this probability problem. The question is asking for the probability that the sum of two dice rolls is 7. Alright, first, I need to remember how probability works for dice. Each die has 6 faces, so when rolling two dice, the total number of possible outcomes should be 6 multiplied by 6, which is 36. That makes sense because each die is independent, so each outcome on the first die can pair with any outcome on the second die.\n",

Let me count them again to be sure: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). Yep, that's six combinations.\n",

This implies that a² is even because it's equal to 2 times some integer (b²). If a² is even, then a must also be even. Because the square of an odd number is odd, so if a were odd, a² would be odd, which contradicts a² being even. Therefore, a is even, which means a can be written as 2k for some integer k.\n",
